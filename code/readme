`R_codeV4.R` is the version of the model shared by Brendan 
`R_codeV5.R` is the version modified by Roslyn to have male and female immature stages, read parameters in from excel, and save 
outputs as .csv
`R_codeV6.R` is the version first modified by Matt to do things. Note that this file uses the readxl package rather than xlsx to avoid Java.
`R_codeV7.R` os the version modified by Matt to use steady state calculations based on updated model structure, and used to generate Epidemics9 results.

`model_functions.R` is the version with a single immature stage, and `model_functions_imm-sex.R` is the version with divided female and male immature stages (though currently these should be mathematically identical given nothing happens in the immature stage).
Similarly, `create_model_parameters*.R` has been forked for either the single or sex-based immature stage.

## What to run to re-create the results for Epidemics9

0. run `create_model_parameters.R` to update all the parameters pass to the different scenarios.
1. run each of the scripts `run_scenario_OF_X_FCP_Y.R` where X={1,5,15}, Y={1e-2, 1e-4}.
2. run `collect_data_for_plotting.R`
3. run the various plot creating scripts: `create_cost_time_prob_plots.R`, `create_cost_time_supression_plots.R`, `create_stormcloud_plots.R`
4. Find the resulting plots in `red-wolbachia/img/`

NB: "stormcloud" refers to the plots of "proportion of initial population" vs time, with grey lines the realisations, and darker line the median/most central realisation, and the lighter shading representing the 90th percentile band.
